# research-paper-classification

### notes;

using arxiv.org's and thinking on results that will fetch `cat:bioT` papers we can do something along the lines of 

```python
anatomical_structures = {
    "heart": "organ",
    "liver": "organ",
    "kidney": "organ",
    "cardiac muscle": "tissue",
    "epithelial": "tissue",
    "connective": "tissue",
    "muscle tissue": "tissue",
    "nervous tissue": "tissue",
}```

 **not scalable?**
